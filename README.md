## ERC-1337
### ETHEREUM SUBSCRIPTION STANDARD

A STANDARDIZED INTERFACE FOR RECURRING SUBSCRIPTIONS ON THE BLOCKCHAIN.

We suggest the reason for this standard is interoperability - we want wallets to understand that you’re about to sign a recurring payment contract so that they can present you with a UI that summarises the agreement you’re about to enter into. As your wallet now knows you’ve entered into a subscription contract it can also provide appropriate UI for managing and cancelling your subscriptions in future.

We also believe that creating momentum for Saas models in the Ethereum space is critical, and believe that the standard is a trojan horse for doing so.
